## Problem Context
Our client is an online retailer based in the UK. They sell all-occasion gifts, and many of their customers are wholesalers.

* Most of their customers are from the UK, but they have a small percent of customers from other countries.
* They want to create groups of these international customers based on their previous purchase patterns.
* Their goal is to provide more tailored services and improve the way they market to these international customers.

## Task
The retailer has hired us to help them create customer clusters, a.k.a "customer segments," through a data-driven approach.

* They've provided us a dataset of past purchase data at the transaction level (you'll see why this will be important).
* Our task is to build a clustering model using that dataset.
* Our clustering model should factor in both aggregate sales patterns and specific items purchased.
