The Real Estate Investment firm has hired us to find a data-driven approach to valuing properties.

They currently have an untapped dataset of transaction prices for previous properties on the market.
Our task is to build a real-estate pricing model using that dataset.
If we can build a model to predict transaction prices with an average error of under $70,000, then our client can replace inexperienced appraisers with our model.
