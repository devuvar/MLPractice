The HR department has hired us as data science consultants. They want to supplement their exit interviews with a more proactive approach.

They've asked their business intelligence analysts to provide us a dataset of past employees and their status (still employed or already left).
Our task is to build a classification model using that dataset.
Because our solution will be complementary to the existing one, and because there's no precedent, we do not have a quantifiable win condition. Just build the best model possible.
